A lightweight, developer-focused macOS Menu Bar-only app for managing and transforming Clipboard data.

Clipboard Envy is [available in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clipboard-envy/id6759918875) or can be downloaded directly from [this project's releases](https://github.com/centennial-oss/clipboard-envy/releases).

## About

Clipboard Envy lives in your Menu Bar so you can capture, store, transform, and recall text snippets without leaving your workflow. It's ideal for developers who use tools like JWT Decoders, SHA-1 Hashers, JSON Minifiers, etc. We have over 100 built-in tools, organized in a coherent, easy-access Menu.

In addition to developer tools, Clipboard Envy is great for the average user to do things like:
- Quickly capture snippets that you don't want to lose, like tracking numbers
- Blocks of text you need to temporarily stash somewhere while rearranging an article or paper
- Frequently used snippets (boilerplate, shell commands, links, public keys, how-to steps)

## Features

- **Menu Bar access** — Runs only in the macOS Menu Bar for quick access
- **Capture Snippet from Clipboard** — One-click to save the current clipboard contents to the stash, and to set back to the Clipbard
- **Open URL** — Quickly open URL snippets from the Menu Bar
- **Analyze Clipboard** - Reveals context-specific info about the Clipboard contents like word and line counts, as well as zero-width unicode character detection.
- **Transform Clipboard Data** - Developer-friendly one-click transformations like convert clipboard contents to lowercase, prettify/minify JSON, Base64-encode/decode, sort and de-duplicate lines, and more!
- **Set Clipboard Data** - One-click to set the clipboard contents to the current epoch timestamp, random values like generated passwords or UUIDs, filler text like Lorem Ipsum, and common symbols that aren't on most keyboards.
